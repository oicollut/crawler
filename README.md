This repository is a collection of small code files I used to retrieve public data 
(descriptions, names, mileage, community reviews, etc) from websites about hiking. 
The idea was to find and retrieve the correct data, parse it and store in JSON or 
Excel format to use for AI model training (GPT3).
This is all experimental and was used for practice and learning only.
